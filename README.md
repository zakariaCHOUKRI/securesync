# SecureSync: Versioned File Synchronization Tool

SecureSync is a comprehensive file synchronization tool with version management capabilities. It is built using C++ as the primary programming language, the Qt framework for the graphical user interface (GUI), and basic socket programming for remote file synchronization. This project also incorporates secure file transfer protocols, multithreading for enhanced performance, and robust security measures.

## Features

- **Intuitive GUI**: Built using the Qt framework, offering a straightforward and easy-to-navigate interface.
- **Local File Synchronization**: Enables users to select folders, compare file versions, and synchronize files locally.
- **Version Control**: Tracks file changes, timestamps, and user modifications, with the option to revert to previous versions.
- **Secure Authentication**: Integrates a secure login system, utilizing password hashing and secure storage.
- **Remote Synchronization**: Supports file synchronization over networks, employing basic socket programming for secure transfers.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Robust mechanisms to handle various issues like network errors, file conflicts, along with a detailed logging system for tracking activities and errors.
