# SecureSync: Versioned File Synchronization Tool

SecureSync is a comprehensive file synchronization tool with version management capabilities. It is built using C++ as the primary programming language, the Qt framework for the graphical user interface (GUI), and basic socket programming for remote file synchronization. This project also incorporates secure file transfer protocols, multithreading for enhanced performance, and robust security measures.

## Features

- **User-Friendly GUI**: A clean and intuitive interface using Qt widgets for easy navigation.
- **Local File Synchronization**: Core functionality for selecting folders, comparing file versions, and updating files locally.
- **Version Management**: Keep track of changes, timestamps, and user modifications, allowing users to roll back to previous file versions.
- **Secure Authentication**: Integration of a secure login system with hashed and securely stored passwords.
- **Remote File Synchronization**: Extend the tool to support remote file synchronization over a network using basic socket programming.
- **Multithreading**: Introduce multithreading to enhance the performance of file synchronization processes.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Implement mechanisms to handle network issues, file conflicts, and a logging system to track synchronization activities and errors.
- **Security Enhancements**: Implement secure file transfer protocols, such as SSH or SSL, to encrypt data during remote synchronization.
